#The King's Awards for Enterprise <%= @year %> [<%= @form_answer.urn %>]

Dear <%= @name %>,

Thank you for your application for a King's Award for Enterprise.

I am sorry to inform you that, on this occasion, your application was unsuccessful.

I do appreciate that this news will be disappointing however, I hope you will find the assessors' comprehensive feedback helpful, which is provided on your application account online. It often takes more than one attempt to achieve an Award, and unsuccessful applicants have reported that the assessors' feedback has helped them to review their business practices, and submit a stronger future application. 
  
Please don't forget that applications open again soon on 6 May for the next round, if you would like to reapply.

If, when you submitted your application, you agreed to share your contact details with your local Lord-Lieutenant, they may be in touch with you to discuss your application and feedback. Even if you did not agree, may I encourage you to contact them or discuss your feedback with another independent person, as those who reflect and act upon the assessors' feedback often achieve future success.

You can view your application feedback by logging in to your King's Awards for Enterprise account:

Please also find attached in Annex A information on a range of business support and sources of finance, advice and opportunities available, as well as some useful contacts and initiatives, both within government and externally.

If you have any questions please contact The King's Award helpline at kingsawards@businessandtrade.gov.uk.

Thank you once again for taking the time to apply for The King's Awards for Enterprise and may I wish you every success in the future.

Yours sincerely,

Nichola Bruno
The Secretary
The King's Awards for Enterprise Office
